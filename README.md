Okay so my first uploaded file I am gonna try my best!
Moddall is a SHELLSCRIPT based script tool for beginners and normal Users 

Installation:
           git clone the File into a Folder u want
           Now you have to copy paste this command chmod +x MODDALL.sh
           Actually you are ready to start this tool by going into the folder where u installed the File and write ./MODDALL.sh
            
           A quick tipp: you can replace the Code into the bed.pl script so you can run MODDALL just by typing bed
